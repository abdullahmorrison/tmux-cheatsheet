# Tmux Cheatsheet
My cheatsheet for tmux commands that I constantly forget. [tmuxcheatsheet.com](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/) does this but there are a lot of commands that I don't care about. These are the ones I use.

# Set up
clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/abdullahmorrison/tmux-cheatsheet.git
```
run `cat` on `tmux-cheatsheet.md` to view the cheatsheet

I created an alias `tmuxch` in my zshrc config that will pull this repo if it doesn't exist locally and cat tmux-cheatsheet.md
